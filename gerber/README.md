Advanced protoboard - Finished gerber ZIPs
==========================================

You can directly send these ZIPs to prototype pcb manufacturers
for production. They are all in the common 10x10cm size.

protoboard-5x3.zip
------------------

* 6 small protoboards per pcb, separated by milled slots
* Roughly sized 5x3cm each

protoboard-6x4-breakout.zip
---------------------------

* 3 small protoboards per pcb, separated by milled slots
* Roughly sized 6x4cm each
* 17 adapters for SC-70
* 4 adapters for TSSOP-14
* 4 adapters for TSSOP-16

I got the feedback from a user that JLCPCB/Easyeda refused to manufacture this design because the
SC-70 adapters are too small for their half-cut hole process. So either remove the SC-70 adapters
in KiCAD or a gerber editor or order this design at another manufacturer.

protoboard-10x5.zip
-------------------

* 2 protoboards per pcb, separated by milled slots
* Roughly sized 10x5cm each
