Advanced protoboard - Finished gerber ZIPs
==========================================

You can directly send these ZIPs to prototype pcb manufacturers
for production. They are all in the common 10x10cm size.

protoboard-5x3.zip
------------------

* 6 small protoboards per pcb, separated by milled slots
* Roughly sized 5x3cm each

protoboard-6x4-breakout.zip
---------------------------

* 3 small protoboards per pcb, separated by milled slots
* Roughly sized 6x4cm each
* 17 adapters for SC-70
* 4 adapters for TSSOP-14
* 4 adapters for TSSOP-16

I got the feedback from a user that JLCPCB/Easyeda refused to manufacture this design because of the
half-cut holes in the breakout adapters.

I don't know yet if they always do that or if they do it just sometimes. Please
give feedback, either at  
https://github.com/electroniceel/protoboard/issues/2  
or

protoboard-10x5.zip
-------------------

* 2 protoboards per pcb, separated by milled slots
* Roughly sized 10x5cm each

protoboard-10x10.zip
-------------------

* one large protoboard in 10x10cm, no slots
* No photo as I haven't received pcbs of this design yet

protoboard-10x5-gndplane.zip
-------------------

* 2 protoboards per pcb, separated by milled slots
* Roughly sized 10x5cm each
* variant with gnd plane (see https://github.com/electroniceel/protoboard#bottom-variants-ground-plane-option)

protoboard-5x3-gndplane.zip
------------------
